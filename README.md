Project Idea: Cheapest Sports Ticket Finder

Overview: Our project aims to develop a web-based platform that assists users in finding the sports tickets. Users can search their event's date and view ticket listings from various sources, compare prices, and make informed purchasing decisions.

Utilization of Database(SQLlite): The application will utilize a database to store event details, ticket prices, seating information, and user profiles. The database will also serve as a cache to optimize data retrieval.

Correlation of Data Sets via API: To provide users with the best ticket deals, we will integrate with publicly available data sources, which are seatgeek and Ticketmaster. This correlation will enable us to display real-time ticket pricing and availability.

Third-Party Authentication(Flask_OAuth): Users can log in using their github account, simplifying the login process and enhancing user engagement.

Decoupled Architecture(Flask framework & Python & HTML): The application will follow a decoupled architecture with a front-end and a back-end using Python. The two components will communicate via a RESTful interface.

By focusing on user benefits and applying the specified requirements, this project will help sports enthusiasts find affordable tickets to their favorite events, enhancing their overall sports event experience.
